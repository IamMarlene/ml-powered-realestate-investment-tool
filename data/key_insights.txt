# Key Insights for Real Estate Investors

- Living area is important but shows diminishing returns
- Kitchen quality has the highest room-specific impact
- Location (neighborhood) creates significant price variations independent of features
- Newer homes command a premium, but older renovated homes can offer better value

## ROI on Improvements
- Kitchen remodels offer solid ROI potential
- Bathroom additions provide good ROI in homes with fewer than 2 bathrooms
- Quality improvements generally outperform size expansions
- Finishing a basement adds value while utilizing existing structure
- Exterior quality improvements provide both aesthetic and functional value

## Neighborhood Strategy
- Premium neighborhoods: NridgHt, StoneBr 
- Value neighborhoods: BrDale, Blueste, MeadowV
- Emerging neighborhoods: Somerst, Blmngtn
- Best renovation potential: OldTown, Edwards, IDOTRR

## Investment Types
- Single-family homes show strongest quality premium
- Older homes (41-60 years) show highest renovation ROI
- Townhomes offer lower entry prices but smaller quality premiums
- Properties with unfinished basements provide built-in value-add opportunities
- 1.5-story homes often represent good value (underpriced relative to features)

## Target Property Profile
- Mid-tier quality (5-7) homes have most improvement upside
- Solid structural elements with cosmetic issues offer best value-add

## Market Timing Considerations
